                Ontologies are set of descriptions that provide machine-readable interpretation.
                <br>
                Semantic IoT employs an ontology that describes weather measurements in order to
                organize and integrate the data from the sources.
                <br>
                It can be found below the ontology that serves as basis for the data integration procedure.

            <p class="text-muted">
                The Internet-of-Things (IoT) is composed by Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) that periodically
                collect data from the environment and transmit it to the web, from where it can be globally accessed.
                <br>
                WSNs allow for a coherent picture of the surroundings inasmuch as the sensors deployed by the network
                appropriately cover the desired area.

            <h3>Semantic IoT Platform</h3>
            <hr>
            <p class="text-muted">
                The Semantic IoT platform, therefore, aims at providing semantically enriched IoT data, by employing
                the <a href="https://github.com/jadefr/ontology-wcm">Weather Conditions Ontology</a> to describe and integrate weather measurements.
                <br>
                The platform retrieves data from a set of <a href="index.php?page=data-sources">data sources</a>, adds metadata to the information, according
                to the ontology, and integrates them. The data is displayed with context information.
